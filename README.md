## Features

### Game Import / Scraping

* scan your rom folders and import games to local database<br>
* scrape artwork and game info from various online sources<br>
* import local available data (descriptions, artwork, videos)<br>
* results from all different scrape processes can be mixed together<br>
* two scraping modes: Automatic: Accurate, Interactive: Select Matches<br>
* create local nfo files while scraping (option to reimport local files without scraping)<br>
* create scrape result files (missing artwork, missing descriptions, possible mismatches)<br>
* import options dialog: asks for most important import options on every game import</ul>

### Game Browsing
* filter games by console, genre, year, publisher and first character<br>
* automatic video playback in video window<br>
* game details page<br>
* different views of the main window<br>
* configurable image placing (choose filetype for background, gamelist, etc.)<br>
* fully skinnable UI: already skinned for Estuary, Confluence, Night and Carmichael (other skins will use the Estuary look and feel)<br>
* dedicated MAME views to display cabinets and marquees</ul>

### Game Launching
* launch roms and standalone games in solo or non-solo mode (solo mode quits XBMC and relaunches it when you quit the emulator)<br>
* supports direct launching of savestate files<br>
* detect games in zip and 7z archives and ask user which game to load<br>
* store game launch count in db<br>
* restore viewstate when returning to RCB</ul>

RCB scrapes data from these sites (don't forget to visit, register and contribute!):<br>
* [http://thegamesdb.net](http://thegamesdb.net) - game data + artwork (boxfront, boxback, fanart)<br>
* [http://www.giantbomb.com](http://www.giantbomb.com) - game data + artwork (screenshot)<br>
* [http://www.mobygames.com](http://www.mobygames.com) - game data + artwork (screenshot, boxfront, boxback,     cartridge)<br>

RCB also imports game information from some file formats that you need to download first. See [the wiki](https://github.com/maloep/romcollectionbrowser/wiki/UseOfflineGameDescriptions) for more information.
